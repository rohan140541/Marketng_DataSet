# Marketng_DataSet
Executive Summary
The analysis of the marketing dataset provides comprehensive insights into customer behavior, focusing on how demographics and socioeconomic factors influence purchasing patterns. These findings can directly inform targeted marketing strategies and customer engagement plans.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset underwent rigorous cleaning and preparation steps:

Column Standardization: Names were updated for better readability and consistency.
Date Handling: Relevant fields were converted to a datetime format for easier analysis of trends over time.
Outlier Identification and Treatment:
Age (Year of Birth): Outliers representing unrealistic ages (over 100 years) were removed. Specifically, data points for birth years like 1893, 1899, and 1900 were flagged.
Income: Extreme income values (e.g., $666,666) were identified and removed as they were significantly above the second-highest value (~$160,000). Lower-income outliers were also addressed to maintain accuracy.
